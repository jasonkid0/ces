Saint Francis of Assisi College empowers a learner with a solid academic foundation. It goes beyond the primary mission and raises the learner in an environment driven by commitment, opportunity, respect and excellence. While the goals of all scholastic undertakings continuously strengthen the academic structure, the goals of all other activities are geared towards physical, social, spiritual, emotional, and cultural development. It is this dynamic synergy of a progressive curriculum and a richly diversified set of extra-curricular activities that create a relevant and holistic Franciscan experience. This is further enhanced by Filipino values which prepare the students to be a successful learner and motivate the student to be an active contributor to the global community.<br><br>

The word “Academics” is in black to denote strength and sturdiness. “And beyond” is in red to represent SFAC’s school color. It is also italicized to indicate a forward motion, to represent progressiveness.<br><br>
