              <h4>My dear Franciscans and Anthonians,</h4>

                <p>"Here's a toast to the future, a toast to the past, and a toast to our friends, far and near." New Year brings another chance for us to set things right and open up a new chapter in our lives.</p>
                
                <p>Today, as Francsicans and Antonians gather with families and friends, I want to wish everyone a healthy New Year.</p>
                
                <p>As glasses are raised and fireworks explode into the sky, it is important that we recognize the special symbolism that the New Year conveys to us. It marks an opportunity to set new goals or a chance for a fresh start. It is just like starting a new chapter in your life and writes an incredible story for yourself.</p>
                
                <p>This is the time when we dream big dreams, to set big goals and achieve all that you are wishing for. Think of your blessings. Think of the opportunities that come your way. And while 2020 was difficult for many, we must also look back on this year with the knowledge that brighter days are ahead of us-that although challenges are great, each of us has the courage and determination to rise up and meet them.</p>
                
                <p>Start the New Year by reevaluating your income, expenses and general spending habits. Think of your priorities. How will you live each day in contentment? We belong to a consumer-driven check society where spending doesn't matter most to us. We are fond on giving lavished gifts even in a small occasions. Yet we do not mind about our conspicuous consumption.</p>
                
                <p>My wish for you this New Year is for you to reorganize your priorities. Focus on what is significant and invest on it. Invest boldly on education and strive to reach your goals. Through this, and in the midst of all the challenges that may come, we will build a society that provides opportunities for all people, to brush up their skills and especially to establish in them a strong and steadfast spirit to overcome life's greatest obstacles. It is important that you should establish realistic, actionable financial goals that will set you up for success.</p>
                
                <p>On this New Year, may you change your direction and not dates, change your commitments and not calendar, chage your attitude and not the actions, and bring about a change in your faith, your force, and your focus and not the fruit. May you live up to the promises you have made and may you create for you and your loved ones the happiest New Year ever. </p>
                
                <!--<p><strong> Happy New Year!</strong> </p>-->

                <p>Education at Saint Francis of Assisi College has always been uniquely premised on the fundamental philosophy of the nature of knowledge, reality, and existence, especially when considered as an academic discipline.

In this holistic education, our students have been led to find their identity and purpose, calling forth an intrinsic reverence for life and a passionate love of learning. Self-respect and self-esteem, relationships with others, social and emotional literacy, resiliency in times of difficulties and in facing challenges, and seeing the beauty of what is around were developed to ensure them to achieve long-term success. With the unbending support of parents and guardians, administrators, and teachers, and coupled with the bounteous materials and activities provided for them, this approach has connected their whole person to the community, to the natural world and to primary human values such as compassion, peace, faith and humility within the learning environment.

Congratulations, dear graduates. Keep on excelling with faith in God and in yourselves! Persevere in championing with humility! Surely, the pathway to success will be just a “walkaway”.</p>
